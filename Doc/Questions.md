# Questions from Implementation #

`balanceTree()`
1) Can we assume that node values will only ever be integers?
2) ~~Do we need to change the `tree2` variable reference to a balanced tree or 
   just return a tree that has all the same values?~~
3) To replace the tree can I break the root links and start over or is there 
   an easier way?

`nodesInLevel()`
1) If I hit a node that is null, do I `return` or `return total`?
